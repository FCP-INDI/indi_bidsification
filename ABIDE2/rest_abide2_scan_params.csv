Stimulus presentation was via Nordic Neurolab goggles and headphones and the participants had a response device (button press) in the scanner. Resting state scan was collected with eyes closed.

The mock scanner simulates the most important aspects of the actual scanning session, including the feeling of being within the MR-bore, wearing headphones that plays recorded gradient sounds, and the ability to watch a forward-projected film via a mirror positioned on the head coil. The purpose of the mock scanning session was to provide an Interleavedroduction to the scanning environment and to offer the opportunity for the child or parent to opt out of the procedure before going to the actual MRI scanner. The children and their parents were asked several questions over their anxiety level and whether they thought it was fun or not. These questions were asked before the mock scanning session, immediately after the mock scanning session, and immediately after the actual MRI scan. If, at any poInterleaved, the child responded to a visual analog scale that they were either too scared or that they found it not at all fun, we stopped immediately and the child was not scanned. Data collection was also stopped based on the parents and researchers ratings of the childÌ¥s fear along the same visual analog scale; if ratings indicated that the child was too scared data collection was stopped. The children were able to watch a film during the structural MRI acquisition, which was the initial Sequentialuence obtained following the localizer scans. The film and sound was turned off during the resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging Sequentialuence and the children were asked to keep their eyes closed and to think about nothing in particular.",AC/PC Aligned (Axial / Oblique)ETHZ 1,Philips,Achieva,Head,32 Chan,,,EPI,90,0.025,2,,,,,,40,Axial,j,seq-,3,3,Rectangle,240x240,80x77,3x3.1,210,7:06,FS,,Rest,participants were reminded via the scanner Interleavedercom to remain as still as possible and fixate on a crosshair presented on the screen.,Resting state was collected with subject's eyes open and fixated on a crosshair in the center of the screen.,GU 1,Siemens,TriTim,Head,12 Chan,3,,EPI,90,0.03,2,2442,,Yes,GRAPPA,2,43,Axial,j,int+,2.5,3,Rectangle,192x192,64x64,3x3,154,5:14,,Tracking,Rest,"Participants were asked to rest with their eyes open, but to remain awake.","Each participant underwent a resting state scan lasting 5 min, 14 s in which they were asked to rest with their eyes open, but to remain awake.

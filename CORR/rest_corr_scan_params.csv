Instructions were to lie still and close eyes [or fixate] during the five-minute acquisition.",Utah 1,Siemens,TrioTim,Head,12 Chan,3T,EPI,90,0.028,2,2894,No,,,,,40,Axial,j,"1000.0,0.0,1050.0,50.0,1100.0,100.0,1150.0,150.0,1200.0,200.0,1250.0,250.0,1300.0,300.0,1350.0,350.0,1400.0,400.0,1450.0,450.0,1500.0,500.0,1550.0,550.0,1600.0,600.0,1650.0,650.0,1700.0,700.0,1750.0,750.0,1800.0,800.0,1850.0,850.0,1900.0,900.0,1950.0,950.0",Interleaved Ascending,3,3.3,Rectangle,220x220,64x64,3.4x3.4,240,8:06,FS,Correction,rest,Keep eyes open and let mind wander.,Typically developing participants were scanned at least 2 years apart.

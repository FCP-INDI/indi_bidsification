Remember that when you see the 'Rest' on the screen, it means you can breathe normally.  Also remember, if you cant hold your breath for the entire time the circles are on the screen, thats okay. Just try your best and  keep as still as possible when youre taking those deep breaths. This scan will be about 4 minutes.",

    "TaskDescription": "The MSIT task was implemented using the more recent\rdescription of the task by Bush and colleague]. The MSIT is a block design that begins and ends with\r28-second blocks of fixation and involves four 42-second blocks of coherent stimuli interleaved with four\r42-second blocks of incoherent stimuli. Each stimuli is presented for 1.75 s and involves three numerals,\rtwo of which are always the same and one that always differs (target). The participant is\rinstructed to press a button on a button box that corresponds to the value of the target numeral. During\r2 coherent trials, the non-target numerals are always zero and the value of the target numeral corresponds\rto its position. During incoherent trials, the non-target numerals are non-zero and the target numeral does\rnot correspond to its position. Prior to each run of the MSIT, participants were reminded of the task\rinstructions and asked to respond as accurately and quickly as possible."

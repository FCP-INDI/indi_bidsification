  "TaskDescription": "Subjects completed a modified version of the 2-cannon task (Tamborello et al. 2012). There were two resting-state blocks in each experiment, one before the task blocks and the other after the task blocks . During functional scanning, subjects were presented with a fixation cross and instructed to keep their eyes open, stare at the fixation, relax and move as little as possible."
